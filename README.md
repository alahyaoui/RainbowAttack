# Definition

### Rainbow Table Attack
A rainbow table attack is a type of hacking wherein the perpetrator tries to use a rainbow hash table to crack the passwords stored in a database system. A rainbow table is a hash function used in cryptography for storing important data such as passwords in a database.

### Rainbow Table
A rainbow table is a precomputed table for caching the output of cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a key derivation function (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a spaceâ€“time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple key derivation function with one entry per hash.

# Installation
Without a ssh key:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alahyaoui/RainbowAttack.git
```
With a ssh key:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:alahyaoui/RainbowAttack.git
```
# Usage

### Script
You can execute the Demo bash script it will do everything for you
```
$ ./Demo
```
### Or
you can do the following if you do not want to use my bash script

### Compilation
```
$ make all
```
### Execution
#### Generation of the Rainbow Table
```
$ ./executable/rainbow_table_gen <nb_of_chains> <length_of_chains> <pwd_size> <rainbow_table_path>
```

##### Where
> - **nb_of_chains** is the number of heads and tails that you want to generate
> - **length_of_chains** is the length of the chains (head -> tail) of the Rainbow Table
> - **pwd_size** is the allowed size of the head (head need to be the same size as the size of password that you want to crack)
> - **rainbow_table_path** is the name of the output file where the heads and the tails will be stored 
>or you can enters separately each file where
>heads is the name of the output file where the heads will be stored,
>tails is the name of the output file where the tails will be stored"

#### Checking of the Rainbow Table
```
$ ./executable/rainbow_table_check <length_of_chains> <rainbow_table_path>
```
##### Where
> - **length_of_chains** is the length of the chains (head -> tail) of the Rainbow Table
> - **rainbow_table_path** is the name of the output file where the heads and the tails are stored 
>or you can enters separately each file where 
>heads is the name of the output file where the heads are stored,
>tails is the name of the output file where the tails are stored


#### Rainbow Table Attack
```
$ ./executable/rainbow_table_attack <length_of_chains> <pwd_size> <rainbow_table_path> <hash_to_crack_path>
```
##### Where
> - **length_of_chains** is the length of the chains (head -> tail) of the Rainbow Table
> - **pwd_size** the size of the heads of the given Rainbow Table (You need to have 1 rainbow table by the size of the password that you want to crack)
> - **rainbow_table_path** the path of the file of the Rainbow Table
> - **hash_to_crack_path** is the path of the file of hashes to crack
